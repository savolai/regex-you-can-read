# Regex You Can Read - teamwork repository

This here is a private repository to bring together all the parties interested in working on the design and the implementation a new regex syntax and UI. 

The basic ideas the work starts from are in the [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@savolai/regular-expressions-you-can-read-a-new-visual-syntax-526c3cf45df1#.sk2363nfq ) but prototyping and suggestions of all kinds are encouraged. The design is far from finalized at this point.

I wish to keep the discussion constructive and find solutions together. I want to keep the core vision alive but the idea is to do this together and distribute decision making as much as makes sens. Let's embrace each other's ideas and be supportive of each other's learning. Yay!

Should disagreements arise regarding the design, I hope to understand everyone's points of view well. Eventually though I will keep the final say, if it comes to that. Let's hope we can agree on things based on mutual understanding as far as possible. I hope to find technical lead to take charge of the deeper architectural decisions, as we go on.

Feel free to submit pull requests for files you think may be helpful start new discussions as Issues and any ideas you would like to share in the Wiki. 

Please note that this isn't the actual public repository for the project. Rather it's a private repository to figure out the practices we would like to use. I felt that to get started, it would be useful to get to know each other and build a bit of common ground. The public repository will come when we feel it is the right time - any thoughts about the working process are welcome.

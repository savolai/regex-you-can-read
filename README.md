# Regex UCR (Regex You Can Read)

The basic ideas the work starts from are in the [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@savolai/regular-expressions-you-can-read-a-new-visual-syntax-526c3cf45df1#.sk2363nfq ) but prototyping and suggestions of all kinds are encouraged. 

We want  to keep the discussion constructive and find solutions together. Let's to keep the core vision alive but the idea is to do this together, and distribute decision making as much as makes sense. Let's embrace each other's ideas and be supportive of each other's learning. Yay!

In all discussions I welcome all point of views. I hope to understand everyone's argumentatio well. Eventually though I will keep the final say at least on the design decisions, if it comes to that. We hope to find technical lead to take charge of the deeper architectural decisions, as we go on.

Feel free to store files in the repo you think may be helpful start new discussions as Issues and any ideas you would like to share in the Wiki. I've published one new demo in there already :) Looking forward to getting feedback.
